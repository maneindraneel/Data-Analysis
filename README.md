**HW4-Indraneel-Mane** : Part A - EDA. Part B - Linear model and justification for predictor variables.

**HW5-Indraneel-Mane** : EDA on New York housing.  Cross Validation of linear model. Finding most predictive model by applying non linear transformations to independent and dependent variables.

**Linear Regression from scratch** : This file first implements linear regression using package and with and without feature scaling. Then I have implemented closed form solution and gradient descent solution from scratsh for linear regression.
